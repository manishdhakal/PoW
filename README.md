# PoW 

## Simplest proof-of-work implementation

### Introduction

#### Proof-of-work
Proof-of-work is a powerful mechanism to reach consensus or agree upon a decision in a  decentralized network like blockchain.

#### For More Info
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work)
- [Ethereum docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/)

### Code
#### Prerequisites
- Python Interpreter

#### Run code
This code can be run in your local machine by running the following commands in computer terminal:
```
python PoW.py
```

#### Playing with code
You can increase the time complexity of the computation by increasing integer value of the variable `difficulty`. You can add your own transactions in **mempool.json** file.
